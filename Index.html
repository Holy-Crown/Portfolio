				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>Hi there! My name is Basil also known as "Crown" within the gaming space.
						<br>
						<br>
					I'm a first-year multimedia designer student, originally from Copenhagen, but I recently moved to Odense for new experiences and a new career path. Before pursuing my passion for design, I worked as an IT-Technician,<br> but I realized that my true passion lies in creating beautiful and engaging designs that can capture people's attention.
						<br>
						<br>
					I've been using Photoshop since I was 15 years old, and it's safe to say that I'm pretty good at it. In fact, I feel very confident in using multiple programs in the Adobe package, such as Illustrator and InDesign. I've always been a quick learner, so picking up new programs and tec hniques has come quite naturally to me.
						<br>
						<br>
					Apart from my studies, I've also been creating work for gaming tournaments for quite some time now, and I'm still doing it. This has given me plenty of experience in graphic design, as well as working under tight deadlines and pressure. It's been challenging at times, but it's also incredibly rewarding to see my work come to life in such an exciting environment.
					<br>
					<br>
					Overall, I'm a confident and skilled individual with a passion for creativity and design. I'm excited to see where this new career path takes me, and I'm committed to developing my skills further and exploring new opportunities in the field of multimedia design.</p>
